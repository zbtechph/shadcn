# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter with Appwrite authentication implementation

This implements basic Appwrite authentication for Nuxt without relying on a specific UI library, allowing for integration with any UI framework.

This project utilizes ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting, helping to enforce coding standards and ensure consistency across the codebase.


Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
